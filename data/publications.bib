   abstract = {Super-enhancers are important for controlling and defining the expression of cell-specific genes. With research on human disease and biological processes, human H3K27ac ChIP-seq datasets are accumulating rapidly, creating the urgent need to collect and process these data comprehensively and efficiently. More importantly, many studies showed that super-enhancer-Associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and transcription factors (TFs) strongly influence human disease and biological processes. Here, we developed a comprehensive human super-enhancer database (SEdb, http://www.licpathway.net/sedb) that aimed to provide a large number of available resources on human super-enhancers. The database was annotated with potential functions of super-enhancers in the gene regulation. The current version of SEdb documented a total of 331 601 super-enhancers from 542 samples. Especially, unlike existing super-enhancer databases, we manually curated and classified 410 available H3K27ac samples from >2000 ChIP-seq samples from NCBI GEO/SRA. Furthermore, SEdb provides detailed genetic and epigenetic annotation information on super-enhancers. Information includes common SNPs, motif changes, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL), risk SNPs, transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), CRISPR/Cas9 target sites and Dnase I hypersensitivity sites (DHSs) for in-depth analyses of super-enhancers. SEdb will help elucidate super-enhancer-related functions and find potential biological effects.},

We also provide our perspective regarding the proposition that super-enhancers are a regulatory entity conceptually distinct from what was known before the introduction of the term. Our opinion is that there is not yet strong evidence that super-enhancers are a novel paradigm in gene regulation and that use of the term in this context is not currently justified. However, the term likely identifies strong enhancers that exhibit behaviors consistent with previous models and concepts of transcriptional regulation. In this respect, the super-enhancer definition is useful in identifying regulatory elements likely to control genes important for cell type specification.},

   abstract = {Critical developmental control genes sometimes contain "shadow" enhancers that can be located in remote positions, including the introns of neighboring genes [1]. They nonetheless produce patterns of gene expression that are the same as or similar to those produced by more proximal primary enhancers. It was suggested that shadow enhancers help foster robustness in gene expression in response to environmental or genetic perturbations [2, 3]. We critically tested this hypothesis by employing a combination of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) recombineering and quantitative confocal imaging methods [2, 4]. Evidence is presented that the snail gene is regulated by a distal shadow enhancer located within a neighboring locus. Removal of the proximal primary enhancer does not significantly perturb snail function, including the repression of neurogenic genes and formation of the ventral furrow during gastrulation at normal temperatures. However, at elevated temperatures, there is sporadic loss of snail expression and coincident disruptions in gastrulation. Similar defects are observed at normal temperatures upon reductions in the levels of Dorsal, a key activator of snail expression (reviewed in [5]). These results suggest that shadow enhancers represent a novel mechanism of canalization whereby complex developmental processes "bring about one definite end-result regardless of minor variations in conditions" [6]. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we examine the hunchback P2 (HbP2) enhancer which drives a sharp expression pattern in the Drosophila blastoderm embryo in response to the transcriptional activator Bicoid (Bcd). We systematically interrogate cis and trans factors that influence the shape and position of expression driven by HbP2, and find that the prevailing model, based on pairwise cooperative binding of Bcd to HbP2 is not adequate. We demonstrate that other proteins, such as pioneer factors, Mediator and histone modifiers influence the shape and position of the HbP2 expression pattern. Comparing our results to theory reveals how higher-order cooperativity and energy expenditure impact boundary location and sharpness. Our results emphasize that the bacterial view of transcription regulation, where pairwise interactions between regulatory proteins dominate, must be reexamined in animals, where multiple molecular mechanisms collaborate to shape the gene regulatory function.},

   abstract = {Genes include cis-regulatory regions that contain transcriptional enhancers. Recent reports have shown that developmental genes often possess multiple discrete enhancer modules that drive transcription in similar spatio-temporal patterns: primary enhancers located near the basal promoter and secondary, or ĝ€̃ shadowĝ€™, enhancers located at more remote positions. It has been proposed that the seemingly redundant activity of primary and secondary enhancers contributes to phenotypic robustness. We tested this hypothesis by generating a deficiency that removes two newly discovered enhancers of shavenbaby (svb, a transcript of the ovo locus), a gene encoding a transcription factor that directs development of Drosophila larval trichomes. At optimal temperatures for embryonic development, this deficiency causes minor defects in trichome patterning. In embryos that develop at both low and high extreme temperatures, however, absence of these secondary enhancers leads to extensive loss of trichomes. These temperature-dependent defects can be rescued by a transgene carrying a secondary enhancer driving transcription of the svb cDNA. Finally, removal of one copy of wingless, a gene required for normal trichome patterning, causes a similar loss of trichomes only in flies lacking the secondary enhancers. These results support the hypothesis that secondary enhancers contribute to phenotypic robustness in the face of environmental and genetic variability. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In this study, we employ quantitative live imaging methods to assess the function of pairs of primary and shadow enhancers in the regulation of key patterning genes-knirps, hunchback, and snail-in developing Drosophila embryos. The knirps enhancers exhibit additive, sometimes even super-additive activities, consistent with classical gene fusion studies. In contrast, the hunchback enhancers function sub-additively in anterior regions containing saturating levels of the Bicoid activator, but function additively in regions where there are diminishing levels of the Bicoid gradient. Strikingly sub-additive behavior is also observed for snail, whereby removal of the proximal enhancer causes a significant increase in gene expression. Quantitative modeling of enhancer–promoter interactions suggests that weakly active enhancers function additively while strong enhancers behave sub-additively due to competition with the target promoter.},

Improved understanding of the roles that super-enhancers play in biology would be afforded by knowing the constellation of factors that constitute these domains and by identifying super-enhancers across the spectrum of human cell types. We describe here the population of transcription factors, cofactors, chromatin regulators, and transcription apparatus occupying super-enhancers in embryonic stem cells and evidence that super-enhancers are highly transcribed. We produce a catalog of super-enhancers in a broad range of human cell types and find that super-enhancers associate with genes that control and define the biology of these cells. Interestingly, disease-associated variation is especially enriched in the super-enhancers of disease-relevant cell types. Furthermore, we find that cancer cells generate super-enhancers at oncogenes and other genes important in tumor pathogenesis. Thus, super-enhancers play key roles in human cell identity in health and in disease. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Numerous studies have documented the fidelity of these expression patterns, even when embryos are subjected to genetic or environmental stress, but the underlying mechanisms for this transcriptional precision are uncertain. Here we present evidence that every gap gene contains multiple enhancers with overlapping activities to produce authentic patterns of gene expression. For example, a recently identified hunchback (hb) enhancer (located 5-kb upstream of the classic enhancer) ensures repression at the anterior pole. The combination of intronic and 5′ knirps (kni) enhancers produces a faithful expression pattern, even though the intronic enhancer alone directs an abnormally broad expression pattern.

   abstract = {Multiple regulatory regions have the potential to regulate a single gene, yet how these elements combine to affect gene expression remains unclear. To uncover the combinatorial relationships between enhancers, we developed Enhancer-interference (Enhancer-i), a CRISPR interference-based approach that uses 2 different repressive domains, KRAB and SID, to prevent enhancer activation simultaneously at multiple regulatory regions. We applied Enhancer-i to promoter-distal estrogen receptor α binding sites (ERBS), which cluster around estradiol-responsive genes and therefore may collaborate to regulate gene expression. Targeting individual sites revealed predominant ERBS that are completely required for the transcriptional response, indicating a lack of redundancy. Simultaneous interference of different ERBS combinations identified supportive ERBS that contribute only when predominant sites are active. Using mathematical modeling, we find strong evidence for collaboration between predominant and supportive ERBS. Overall, our findings expose a complex functional hierarchy of enhancers, where multiple loci bound by the same transcription factor combine to fine-tune the expression of target genes. Carleton et al. have developed a CRISPR-based technique, Enhancer-i, which enables simultaneous deactivation of multiple enhancers and allows for the functional dissection of how enhancers work together to regulate gene expression. They used Enhancer-i to identify estrogen receptor α bound enhancers required for the transcriptional response to estrogens and discovered that specific combinations of enhancers collaborate to produce the estrogen response.},

Integrated analysis of islet data with those from nine cell types identified specific and significant enrichment of type 2 diabetes and related quantitative trait GWAS variants in islet enhancers. Our integrated chromatin maps reveal that most enhancers are short (median = 0.8 kb). Each cell type also contains a substantial number of more extended (3 kb) enhancers. Interestingly, these stretch enhancers are often tissue-specific and overlap locus control regions, suggesting that they are important chromatin regulatory beacons. Indeed, we show that (i ) tissue specificity of enhancers and nearby gene expression increase with enhancer length; (ii ) neighborhoods containing stretch enhancers are enriched for important cell type-specific genes; and (iii) GWAS variants associated with traits relevant to a particular cell type are more enriched in stretch enhancers compared with short enhancers.

These domains, which we call super-enhancers, consist of clusters of enhancers that are densely occupied by the master regulators and Mediator. Super-enhancers differ from typical enhancers in size, transcription factor density and content, ability to activate transcription, and sensitivity to perturbation. Reduced levels of Oct4 or Mediator cause preferential loss of expression of super-enhancer-associated genes relative to other genes, suggesting how changes in gene expression programs might be accomplished during development. In other more differentiated cells, super-enhancers containing cell-type-specific master transcription factors are also found at genes that define cell identity.

   abstract = {DNA variants (SNPs) that predispose to common traits often localize within noncoding regulatory elements such as enhancers. Moreover, loci identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) often contain multiple SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD), any of which may be causal. Thus, determining the effect of these multiple variant SNPs on target transcript levels has been a major challenge. Here, we provide evidence that for six common autoimmune disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, multiple sclerosis, lupus, and ulcerative colitis), the GWAS association arises from multiple polymorphisms in LD that map to clusters of enhancer elements active in the same cell type. This finding suggests a "multiple enhancer variant" hypothesis for common traits, where several variants in LD impact multiple enhancers and cooperatively affect gene expression. Using a novel method to delineate enhancergene interactions, we show that multiple enhancer variants within a given locus typically target the same gene. Using available data from HapMap and B lymphoblasts as a model system, we provide evidence at numerous loci that multiple enhancer variants cooperatively contribute to altered expression of their gene targets. The effects on target transcript levels tend to be modest and can be either gain- or loss-of-function. Additionally, the genes associated with multiple enhancer variants encode proteins that are often functionally related and enriched in common pathways. Overall, the multiple enhancer variant hypothesis offers a new paradigm by which noncoding variants can confer susceptibility to common traits. © 2014 Corradin et al.},

Putative enhancers are established by binding of the pioneer factor C/EBPa followed by chromatin opening and enhancer RNA (eRNA) synthesis from H3K4-monomethylated regions. Using eRNA synthesis as a proxy for enhancer activity, we find that most putative enhancers cooperate in an additive way to regulate transcription of assigned target genes. However, transcription from 136 target genes depends exponentially on the summed activity of its putative paired enhancers, indicating that these enhancers cooperate synergistically. The target genes are cell type-specific, suggesting that enhancer synergy can contribute to cell fate determination. Enhancer synergy appears to depend on cell type-specific transcription factors, and such interacting enhancers are not predicted from occupancy or accessibility data that are used to detect superenhancers.},

However, little is known about regulatory redundancy in vertebrates and in genes mainly expressed during adulthood. Here we study nPE1 and nPE2, two phylogenetically conserved mammalian enhancers that drive expression of the proopiomelanocortin gene (Pomc) to the same set of hypothalamic neurons. The simultaneous deletion of both enhancers abolished Pomc expression at all ages and induced a profound metabolic dysfunction including early-onset extreme obesity. Targeted inactivation of either nPE1 or nPE2 led to very low levels of Pomc expression during early embryonic development indicating that both enhancers function synergistically. In adult mice, however, Pomc expression is controlled additively by both enhancers, with nPE1 being responsible for ∼80% and nPE2 for ∼20% of Pomc transcription. Consequently, nPE1 knockout mice exhibit mild obesity whereas nPE2-deficient mice maintain a normal body weight. These results suggest that nPE2-driven Pomc expression is compensated by nPE1 at later stages of development, essentially rescuing the earlier phenotype of nPE2 deficiency. Together, these results reveal that cooperative interactions between the enhancers confer robustness of Pomc expression against gene regulatory disturbances and preclude deleterious metabolic phenotypes caused by Pomc deficiency in adulthood. Thus, our study demonstrates that enhancer redundancy can be used by genes that control adult physiology in mammals and underlines the potential significance of regulatory sequence mutations in common diseases.},

We observe highly asymmetric loading of bromodomain 4 (BRD4) at enhancers, with approximately 33% of all BRD4 localizing to enhancers at 1.6% of occupied genes. These super-enhancers prove particularly sensitive to bromodomain inhibition, explaining the selective effect of BET inhibitors on oncogenic and lineage-specific transcriptional circuits.

A paucity of functional data led us to investigate the role of super-enhancers in the mammary gland, an organ characterized by exceptional gene regulatory dynamics during pregnancy. ChIP-seq analysis for the master regulator STAT5A, the glucocorticoid receptor, H3K27ac and MED1 identified 440 mammary-specific super-enhancers, half of which were associated with genes activated during pregnancy. We interrogated the Wap super-enhancer, generating mice carrying mutations in STAT5-binding sites within its constituent enhancers. Individually, the most distal site displayed the greatest enhancer activity. However, combinatorial mutation analysis showed that the 1,000-fold induction in gene expression during pregnancy relied on all enhancers. Disabling the binding sites of STAT5, NFIB and ELF5 in the proximal enhancer incapacitated the entire super-enhancer. Altogether, these data suggest a temporal and functional enhancer hierarchy. The identification of mammary-specific super-enhancers and the mechanistic exploration of the Wap locus provide insights into the regulation of cell-type-specific expression of hormone-sensing genes.},

   abstract = {Summary Embryogenesis is remarkably robust to segregating mutations and environmental variation; under a range of conditions, embryos of a given species develop into stereotypically patterned organisms. Such robustness is thought to be conferred, in part, through elements within regulatory networks that perform similar, redundant tasks. Redundant enhancers (or "shadow" enhancers), for example, can confer precision and robustness to gene expression, at least at individual, well-studied loci. However, the extent to which enhancer redundancy exists and can thereby have a major impact on developmental robustness remains unknown. Here, we systematically assessed this, identifying over 1,000 predicted shadow enhancers during Drosophila mesoderm development. The activity of 23 elements, associated with five genes, was examined in transgenic embryos, while natural structural variation among individuals was used to assess their ability to buffer against genetic variation. Our results reveal three clear properties of enhancer redundancy within developmental systems. First, it is much more pervasive than previously anticipated, with 64% of loci examined having shadow enhancers. Their spatial redundancy is often partial in nature, while the non-overlapping function may explain why these enhancers are maintained within a population. Second, over 70% of loci do not follow the simple situation of having only two shadow enhancers - often there are three (rols), four (CadN and ade5), or five (Traf1), at least one of which can be deleted with no obvious phenotypic effects. Third, although shadow enhancers can buffer variation, patterns of segregating variation suggest that they play a more complex role in development than generally considered.},

   abstract = {The transcription factor Myc is essential for the regulation of haematopoietic stem cells and progenitors and has a critical function in haematopoietic malignancies. Here we show that an evolutionarily conserved region located 1.7 megabases downstream of the Myc gene that has previously been labelled as a a&circ; &euro; super-enhancer' is essential for the regulation of Myc expression levels in both normal haematopoietic and leukaemic stem cell hierarchies in mice and humans. Deletion of this region in mice leads to a complete loss of Myc expression in haematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. This caused an accumulation of differentiation-Arrested multipotent progenitors and loss of myeloid and B cells, mimicking the phenotype caused by Mx1-Cre-mediated conditional deletion of the Myc gene in haematopoietic stem cells. This super-enhancer comprises multiple enhancer modules with selective activity that recruits a compendium of transcription factors, including GFI1b, RUNX1 and MYB. Analysis of mice carrying deletions of individual enhancer modules suggests that specific Myc expression levels throughout most of the haematopoietic hierarchy are controlled by the combinatorial and additive activity of individual enhancer modules, which collectively function as a a&circ; &euro; blood enhancer cluster' (BENC). We show that BENC is also essential for the maintenance of MLL-AF9-driven leukaemia in mice. Furthermore, a BENC module, which controls Myc expression in mouse haematopoietic stem cells and progenitors, shows increased chromatin accessibility in human acute myeloid leukaemia stem cells compared to blasts. This difference correlates with MYC expression and patient outcome. We propose that clusters of enhancers, such as BENC, form highly combinatorial systems that allow precise control of gene expression across normal cellular hierarchies and which also can be hijacked in malignancies.},

Using a combination of advanced proteomics and genomics approaches, we identify ~12,000 transcription factor hotspots (~400bp) in the early phase of adipogenesis, and we find evidence of both simultaneous and sequential binding of transcription factors at these regions. We demonstrate that hotspots are highly enriched in large super-enhancer regions (several kilobases), which drive the early adipogenic reprogramming of gene expression.

Early work revealed remarkable modularity of enhancers, whereby distinct DNA regions drive gene expression in defined spatiotemporal domains. Nevertheless, a few reports have shown that enhancers function in multiple developmental stages, implying that enhancers can be pleiotropic. Here, we have studied the activity of the enhancers of the shavenbaby gene throughout D. melanogaster development. We found that all seven shavenbaby enhancers drive expression in multiple tissues and developmental stages. We explored how enhancer pleiotropy is encoded in two of these enhancers. In one enhancer, the same transcription factor binding sites contribute to embryonic and pupal expression, revealing site pleiotropy, whereas for a second enhancer, these roles are encoded by distinct sites. Enhancer pleiotropy may be a common feature of cis-regulatory regions of developmental genes, and site pleiotropy may constrain enhancer evolution in some cases. Preger-Ben Noon et al. find that shavenbaby gene enhancers contain regulatory information for driving several expression patterns (i.e., enhancers are pleiotropic) and that, in some cases, the transcription factor binding sites that activate these enhancers are reused during development.},

   abstract = {Distant-acting tissue-specific enhancers, which regulate gene expression, vastly outnumber protein-coding genes in mammalian genomes, but the functional importance of this regulatory complexity remains unclear. Here we show that the pervasive presence of multiple enhancers with similar activities near the same gene confers phenotypic robustness to loss-of-function mutations in individual enhancers. We used genome editing to create 23 mouse deletion lines and inter-crosses, including both single and combinatorial enhancer deletions at seven distinct loci required for limb development. Unexpectedly, none of the ten deletions of individual enhancers caused noticeable changes in limb morphology. By contrast, the removal of pairs of limb enhancers near the same gene resulted in discernible phenotypes, indicating that enhancers function redundantly in establishing normal morphology. In a genetic background sensitized by reduced baseline expression of the target gene, even single enhancer deletions caused limb abnormalities, suggesting that functional redundancy is conferred by additive effects of enhancers on gene expression levels. A genome-wide analysis integrating epigenomic and transcriptomic data from 29 developmental mouse tissues revealed that mammalian genes are very commonly associated with multiple enhancers that have similar spatiotemporal activity. Systematic exploration of three representative developmental structures (limb, brain and heart) uncovered more than one thousand cases in which five or more enhancers with redundant activity patterns were found near the same gene. Together, our data indicate that enhancer redundancy is a remarkably widespread feature of mammalian genomes that provides an effective regulatory buffer to prevent deleterious phenotypic consequences upon the loss of individual enhancers.},

However, as we show here, GR binding is a poor predictor of GR-dependent gene regulation even when taking the 3D organization of the genome into account. To connect GR binding sites to the regulation of genes in the endogenous genomic context, we turned to genome editing. By deleting GR binding sites, individually or in combination, we uncovered how cooperative interactions between binding sites contribute to the regulation of genes. Specifically, for the GR target gene GILZ, we show that the simultaneous presence of a cluster of GR binding sites is required for the activity of an individual enhancer and that the GR-dependent regulation of GILZ depends on multiple GR-bound enhancers. Further, by deleting GR binding sites that are shared between different cell types, we show how cell type-specific genome organization and enhancer-blocking can result in cell type-specific wiring of promoter-enhancer contacts. This rewiring allows an individual GR binding site shared between different cell types to direct the expression of distinct transcripts and thereby contributes to the cell type-specific consequences of glucocorticoid signaling.},

However, how chromosome interactions are actually translated into transcriptional outputs remains unclear. Here, to address this question, we use an assay to position an enhancer at large numbers of densely spaced chromosomal locations relative to a fixed promoter, and measure promoter output and interactions within a genomic region with minimal regulatory and structural complexity. A quantitative analysis of hundreds of cell lines reveals that the transcriptional effect of an enhancer depends on its contact probabilities with the promoter through a nonlinear relationship. Mathematical modelling suggests that nonlinearity might arise from transient enhancer–promoter interactions being translated into slower promoter bursting dynamics in individual cells, therefore uncoupling the temporal dynamics of interactions from those of transcription. This uncovers a potential mechanism of how distal enhancers act from large genomic distances, and of how topologically associating domain boundaries block distal enhancers. Finally, we show that enhancer strength also determines absolute transcription levels as well as the sensitivity of a promoter to CTCF-mediated transcriptional insulation. Our measurements establish general principles for the context-dependent role of chromosome structure in long-range transcriptional regulation.},

This is conceivable, as various core promoter sequence elements are differentially distributed between genes of different functions<sup>7</sup>, including elements that are predominantly found at either developmentally regulated or at housekeeping genes<sup>8-10</sup>.

Housekeeping enhancers are active across the two cell types, while developmental enhancers exhibit strong cell-type specificity. Both enhancer classes differ in their genomic distribution, the functions of neighbouring genes, and the core promoter elements of these neighbouring genes.

   abstract = {We previously showed in Drosophila melanogaster embryos that low-affinity Ultrabithorax (Ubx)-responsive shavenbaby (svb) enhancers drive expression using localized transcriptional environments and that active svb enhancers on different chromosomes tended to colocalize (Tsai et al., 2017). Here, we test the hypothesis that these multi-enhancer ‘hubs’ improve phenotypic resilience to stress by buffering against decreases in transcription factor concentrations and transcriptional output. Deleting a redundant enhancer from the svb locus led to reduced trichome numbers in embryos raised at elevated temperatures. Using high-resolution fluorescence microscopy, we observed lower Ubx concentration and transcriptional output in this deletion allele. Transcription sites of the full svb cis-regulatory region inserted into a different chromosome colocalized with the svb locus, increasing Ubx concentration, the transcriptional output of svb, and partially rescuing the phenotype. Thus, multiple enhancers could reinforce a local transcriptional hub to buffer against environmental stresses and genetic perturbations, providing a mechanism for phenotypical robustness.},

To determine the contribution of individual LCR DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) to transcription and nuclear location, in the present study, we compared β-globin gene activity and location in erythroid cells derived from mice with deletions of individual HSs, deletions of 2 HSs, and deletion of the whole LCR and found all of the HSs had a similar spectrum of activities, albeit to different degrees. Each HS acts as an independent module to activate expression in an additive manner, and this is correlated with relocation away from the nuclear periphery. In contrast, HSs have redundant activities with respect to association with TFys and the probability that an allele is actively transcribed, as measured by primary RNA transcript FISH. The limiting effect on RNA levels occurs after β-globin genes associate with TFys, at which time HSs contribute to the amount of RNA arising from each burst of transcription by stimulating transcriptional elongation. © 2011 by The American Society of Hematology.},

   abstract = {Development of the vertebrate nervous system requires the actions of transcription factors that establish regional domains of gene expression, which results in the generation of diverse neuronal cell types. MATH1, a transcription factor of the bHLH class, is expressed during development of the nervous system in multiple neuronal domains, including the dorsal neural tube, the EGL of the cerebellum and the hair cells of the vestibular and auditory systems. MATH1 is essential for proper development of the granular layer of the cerebellum and the hair cells of the cochlear and vestibular systems, as shown in mice carrying a targeted disruption of Math1. Previously, we showed that 21 kb of sequence flanking the Math1-coding region is sufficient for Math1 expression in transgenic mice. Here we identify two discrete sequences within the 21 kb region that are conserved between mouse and human, and are sufficient for driving a lacZ reporter gene in these domains of Math1 expression in transgenic mice. The two identified enhancers, while dissimilar in sequence, appear to have redundant activities in the different Math1 expression domains except the spinal neural tube. The regulatory mechanisms for each of the diverse Math1 expression domains are tightly linked, as separable regulatory elements for any given domain of Math1 expression were not found, suggesting that a common regulatory mechanism controls these apparently unrelated domains of expression. In addition, we demonstrate a role for autoregulation in controlling the activity of the Math1 enhancer, through an essential E-box consensus binding site.},

   abstract = {Systematically assaying the activity of 7,705 candidate enhancers during Drosophila embryogenesis shows that nearly half are active in the embryo and display dynamic spatial patterns during development; enhancer activity is matched to expression patterns of putative target genes and predictive cis-regulatory motifs are identified. Two papers in this issue of Nature examine the role of developmental enhancers in Drosophila melanogaster, an ideal model for the purpose, as it takes just 18 hours from egg laying to completion of embryogenesis and involves marked changes in transcription linked to changes in enhancer activity. Evgeny Kvon et al. systematically assayed the activity of more than 7,000 candidate enhancers. Nearly half of the tested genomic fragments are active in the embryo and display dynamic spatial patterns during development. Enhancer activity is matched to expression patterns of putative target genes and predictive cis-regulatory motifs are identified. Yad Ghavi-Helm et al. present a high-resolution map of enhancer three-dimensional contacts. They find that although there are many local regulatory interactions, long-range interactions are more common. Surprisingly, most interactions appear unchanged between tissues and across development. Thus, transcription initiates from preformed enhancer–promoter loops through release of paused polymerase. The study also implies that the general topology governing enhancer contacts is conserved from flies to humans. Transcriptional enhancers are crucial regulators of gene expression and animal development1 and the characterization of their genomic organization, spatiotemporal activities and sequence properties is a key goal in modern biology2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Here we characterize the in vivo activity of 7,705 Drosophila melanogaster enhancer candidates covering 13.5% of the non-coding non-repetitive genome throughout embryogenesis. 3,557 (46%) candidates are active, suggesting a high density with 50,000 to 100,000 developmental enhancers genome-wide. The vast majority of enhancers display specific spatial patterns that are highly dynamic during development. Most appear to regulate their neighbouring genes, suggesting that the cis-regulatory genome is organized locally into domains, which are supported by chromosomal domains, insulator binding and genome evolution. However, 12 to 21 per cent of enhancers appear to skip non-expressed neighbours and regulate a more distal gene. Finally, we computationally identify cis-regulatory motifs that are predictive and required for enhancer activity, as we validate experimentally. This work provides global insights into the organization of an animal regulatory genome and the make-up of enhancer sequences and confirms and generalizes principles from previous studies1,9. All enhancer patterns are annotated manually with a controlled vocabulary and all results are available through a web interface ( http://enhancers.starklab.org ), including the raw images of all microscopy slides for manual inspection at arbitrary zoom levels.},

These super-enhancers have been proposed to manifest higher-order properties important in development and disease. Here we report a comprehensive functional dissection of one of the strongest putative super-enhancers in erythroid cells. By generating a series of mouse models, deleting each of the five regulatory elements of the α-globin super-enhancer individually and in informative combinations, we demonstrate that each constituent enhancer seems to act independently and in an additive fashion with respect to hematological phenotype, gene expression, chromatin structure and chromosome conformation, without clear evidence of synergistic or higher-order effects.

Further, it is key to understanding how sequence variants affect enhancer function. STARR-seq enables the direct and quantitative assessment of enhancer activity for millions of candidate sequences of arbitrary length and origin in parallel, allowing the screening of entire genomes and the establishment of genome-wide enhancer activity maps. In STARR-seq, the candidate sequences are cloned downstream of the core promoter into a reporter gene's transcription unit (i.e., the 3' UTR). Candidates that function as active enhancers lead to the transcription of reporter mRNAs that harbor the candidates' sequences. This direct coupling of enhancer sequence and enhancer activity in cis enables the straightforward and efficient cloning of complex candidate libraries and the assessment of enhancer activities of millions of candidates in parallel by quantifying the reporter mRNAs by deep sequencing. This article describes how to create focused and genome-wide human STARR-seq libraries and how to perform STARR-seq screens in mammalian cells, and also describes a novel STARR-seq variant (UMI-STARR-seq) that allows the accurate counting of reporter mRNAs for STARR-seq libraries of low complexity. © 2019 The Authors.

Finally, we designed and functionally validated synthetic enhancers with desired activities de novo.

   abstract = {Gene regulation in the human genome is controlled by distal enhancers that activate specific nearby promoters1. A proposed model for this specificity is that promoters have sequence-encoded preferences for certain enhancers, for example, mediated by interacting sets of transcription factors or cofactors2. This ‘biochemical compatibility’ model has been supported by observations at individual human promoters and by genome-wide measurements in Drosophila3–9. However, the degree to which human enhancers and promoters are intrinsically compatible has not yet been systematically measured, and how their activities combine to control RNA expression remains unclear. Here we design a high-throughput reporter assay called enhancer × promoter self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (ExP STARR-seq) and applied it to examine the combinatorial compatibilities of 1,000 enhancer and 1,000 promoter sequences in human K562 cells. We identify simple rules for enhancer–promoter compatibility, whereby most enhancers activate all promoters by similar amounts, and intrinsic enhancer and promoter activities multiplicatively combine to determine RNA output (R2 = 0.82). In addition, two classes of enhancers and promoters show subtle preferential effects. Promoters of housekeeping genes contain built-in activating motifs for factors such as GABPA and YY1, which decrease the responsiveness of promoters to distal enhancers. Promoters of variably expressed genes lack these motifs and show stronger responsiveness to enhancers. Together, this systematic assessment of enhancer–promoter compatibility suggests a multiplicative model tuned by enhancer and promoter class to control gene transcription in the human genome. A new high-throughput assay applied to 1,000 enhancers and 1,000 promoters in human cells reveals how different classes of enhancers and promoters control RNA expression.},

Although some COFs have been shown to prefer certain promoter types2–5 over others (for example, see&nbsp;refs 6,7), the extent to which different COFs display intrinsic specificities for distinct promoters is unclear. Here we use a high-throughput promoter-activity assay in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells to screen 23 COFs for their ability to activate 72,000 candidate core promoters (CPs). We observe differential activation of CPs, indicating distinct regulatory preferences or ‘compatibilities’8,9 between COFs and specific types of CPs. These functionally distinct CP types are differentially enriched for known sequence elements2,4, such as the TATA box, downstream promoter element (DPE) or TCT motif, and display distinct chromatin properties at endogenous loci. Notably, the CP types differ in their relative abundance of H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 marks (see also refs 10–12), suggesting that these histone modifications might distinguish trans-regulatory factors rather than promoter- versus enhancer-type cis-regulatory elements. We confirm the existence of distinct COF–CP compatibilities in two additional Drosophila cell lines and in human cells, for which we find COFs that prefer TATA-box or CpG-island promoters, respectively. Distinct compatibilities between COFs and promoters can explain how different enhancers specifically activate distinct sets of genes9, alternative promoters within the same genes, and distinct transcription start sites within the same promoter13. Thus, COF–promoter compatibilities may underlie distinct transcriptional programs in species as divergent as flies and humans. A screen of 23 transcriptional cofactors for their ability to activate 72,000 candidate core promoters in Drosophila melanogaster identified distinct compatibility groups, providing insight into mechanisms that underlie the selective activation of transcriptional programs.},

   abstract = { Recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to promoters is essential for transcription. Despite conflicting evidence, the Pol II preinitiation complex (PIC) is often thought to have a uniform composition and to assemble at all promoters via an identical mechanism. Here, using Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells as a model, we demonstrate that different promoter classes function via distinct PICs. Promoter DNA of developmentally regulated genes readily associates with the canonical Pol II PIC, whereas housekeeping promoters do not, and instead recruit other factors such as DREF. Consistently, TBP and DREF are differentially required by distinct promoter types. TBP and its paralog TRF2 also function at different promoter types in a partially redundant manner. In contrast, TFIIA is required at all promoters, and we identify factors that can recruit and/or stabilize TFIIA at housekeeping promoters and activate transcription. Promoter activation by tethering these factors is sufficient to induce the dispersed transcription initiation patterns characteristic of housekeeping promoters. Thus, different promoter classes utilize distinct mechanisms of transcription initiation, which translate into different focused versus dispersed initiation patterns.    image    Functionally distinct promoter types are characterized by preferential responsiveness to specific activators and different transcription initiation patterns. This study demonstrates distinct transcription factor requirements and transcription initiation mechanisms at housekeeping vs developmental gene promoters, which translate into dispersed versus focused transcription initiation patterns.    Developmental but not housekeeping core promoter DNA is sufficient to assemble RNA polymerase II preinitiation complexes (PICs) in vitro .    The transcription factor TBP is required for transcription at a subset of developmental promoters, while TFIIA is required at all promoters.   The TBP paralog TRF2 is required for transcription at a subset of developmental and housekeeping promoters and is partially redundant with TBP.   Recruitment of housekeeping or developmental coactivators to minimal promoters is sufficient to reproduce endogenous transcription initiation patterns.   },

   abstract = {One of the most important questions in biology is how transcription factors (TFs) and cofactors control enhancer function and thus gene expression. Enhancer activation usually requires combinations of several TFs, indicating that TFs function synergistically and combinatorially. However, while TF binding has been extensively studied, little is known about how combinations of TFs and cofactors control enhancer function once they are bound. It is typically unclear which TFs participate in combinatorial enhancer activation, whether different TFs form functionally distinct groups, or if certain TFs might substitute for each other in defined enhancer contexts. Here we assess the potential regulatory contributions of TFs and cofactors to combinatorial enhancer control with enhancer complementation assays. We recruited GAL4-DNA-binding-domain fusions of 812 Drosophila TFs and cofactors to 24 enhancer contexts and measured enhancer activities by 82,752 luciferase assays in S2 cells. Most factors were functional in at least one context, yet their contributions differed between contexts and varied from repression to activation (up to 289-fold) for individual factors. Based on functional similarities across contexts, we define 15 groups of TFs that differ in developmental functions and protein sequence features. Similar TFs can substitute for each other, enabling enhancer re-engineering by exchanging TF motifs, and TF-cofactor pairs cooperate during enhancer control and interact physically. Overall, we show that activators and repressors can have diverse regulatory functions that typically depend on the enhancer context. The systematic functional characterization of TFs and cofactors should further our understanding of combinatorial enhancer control and gene regulation.},

It uses statistical thermodynamics theory to model not only protein-DNA interaction, but also the effect of DNA-bound activators and repressors on gene expression. In addition, the model incorporates mechanistic features such as synergistic effect of multiple activators, short range repression, and cooperativity in transcription factor-DNA binding, allowing us to systematically evaluate the significance of these features in the context of available expression data. Using this model on segmentation-related enhancers in Drosophila, we find that transcriptional synergy due to simultaneous action of multiple activators helps explain the data beyond what can be explained by cooperative DNA-binding alone. We find clear support for the phenomenon of short-range repression, where repressors do not directly interact with the basal transcriptional machinery. We also find that the binding sites contributing to an enhancer's function may not be conserved during evolution, and a noticeable fraction of these undergo lineage-specific changes. Our implementation of the model, called GEMSTAT, is the first publicly available program for simultaneously modeling the regulatory activities of a given set of sequences. © 2010 He et al.},

   abstract = {Differential gene expression gives rise to the many cell types of complex organisms. Enhancers regulate transcription by binding transcription factors (TFs), which in turn recruit cofactors to activate RNA Polymerase II at core promoters. Transcriptional regulation is typically mediated by distinct combinations of TFs, enabling a relatively small number of TFs to generate a large diversity of cell types. However, how TFs achieve combinatorial enhancer control and how enhancers, enhancer-bound TFs, and the cofactors they recruit regulate RNA Polymerase II activity is not entirely clear. Here, we review how TF synergy is mediated at the level of DNA binding and after binding, the role of cofactors and the post-translational modifications they catalyze, and discuss different models of enhancer—core-promoter communication.},

   abstract = {Housekeeping genes of animal genomes cluster in the same chromosomal regions. It has long been suggested that this organization contributes to their steady expression across all the tissues of the organism. Here, we show that the activity of Drosophila housekeeping gene promoters depends on the expression of their neighbors. By measuring the expression of ∼85,000 reporters integrated in Kc167 cells, we identified the best predictors of expression as chromosomal contacts with the promoters and terminators of active genes. Surprisingly, the chromatin composition at the insertion site and the contacts with enhancers were less informative. These results are substantiated by the existence of genomic "paradoxical" domains, rich in euchromatic features and enhancers, but where the reporters are expressed at low level, concomitant with a deficit of interactions with promoters and terminators. This indicates that the proper function of housekeeping genes relies not on contacts with long distance enhancers but on spatial clustering. Overall, our results suggest that spatial proximity between genes increases their expression and that the linear architecture of the Drosophila genome contributes to this effect.},

   abstract = {Steroid hormones act as important developmental switches, and their nuclear receptors regulate many genes. However, few hormone-dependent enhancers have been characterized, and important aspects of their sequence architecture, cell-type-specific activating and repressing functions, or the regulatory roles of their chromatin structure have remained unclear. We used STARR-seq, a recently developed enhancer-screening assay, and ecdysone signaling in two different Drosophila cell types to derive genome-wide hormone-dependent enhancer-activity maps. We demonstrate that enhancer activation depends on cis-regulatory motif combinations that differ between cell types and can predict cell-type-specific ecdysone targeting. Activated enhancers are often not accessible prior to induction. Enhancer repression following hormone treatment seems independent of receptor motifs and receptor binding to the enhancer, as we show using ChIP-seq, but appears to rely on motifs for other factors, including Eip74. Our strategy is applicable to study signal-dependentenhancers for different pathways and across organisms. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {We demonstrate the feasibility of generating thousands of transgenic Drosophila melanogaster lines in which the expression of an exogenous gene is reproducibly directed to distinct small subsets of cells in the adult brain. We expect the expression patterns produced by the collection of 5,000 lines that we are currently generating to encompass all neurons in the brain in a variety of intersecting patterns. Overlapping 3-kb DNA fragments from the flanking noncoding and intronic regions of genes thought to have patterned expression in the adult brain were inserted into a defined genomic location by site-specific recombination. These fragments were then assayed for their ability to function as transcriptional enhancers in conjunction with a synthetic core promoter designed to work with a wide variety of enhancer types. An analysis of 44 fragments from four genes found that >80% drive expression patterns in the brain; the observed patterns were, on average, comprised of <100 cells. Our results suggest that the D. melanogaster genome contains >50,000 enhancers and that multiple enhancers drive distinct subsets of expression of a gene in each tissue and developmental stage. We expect that these lines will be valuable tools for neuroanatomy as well as for the elucidation of neuronal circuits and information flow in the fly brain. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

In our current study, we describe the development of novel overlap sequences that can be used for the construction of fusion DNA fragments, including the one-step fusion of three fragments in a single PCR and also for in-frame fusions. Novel poly G or C stretches showed strong and also specific annealing to the complementary sequences in the fusion PCR.

We demonstrate Rsubread's ability to detect exon-exon junctions de novo and to quantify expression at the level of either genes, exons or exon junctions. The resulting read counts can be input directly into a wide range of downstream statistical analyses using other Bioconductor packages. Using SEQC data and simulations, we compare Rsubread to TopHat2, STAR and HTSeq as well as to counting functions in the Bioconductor infrastructure packages. We consider the performance of these tools on the combined quantification task starting from raw sequence reads through to summary counts, and in particular evaluate the performance of different combinations of alignment and counting algorithms. We show that Rsubread is faster and uses less memory than competitor tools and produces read count summaries that more accurately correlate with true values.},

   abstract = {Identifying master regulators of biological processes and mapping their downstream gene networks are key challenges in systems biology. We developed a computational method, called iRegulon, to reverse-engineer the transcriptional regulatory network underlying a co-expressed gene set using cis-regulatory sequence analysis. iRegulon implements a genome-wide ranking-and-recovery approach to detect enriched transcription factor motifs and their optimal sets of direct targets. We increase the accuracy of network inference by using very large motif collections of up to ten thousand position weight matrices collected from various species, and linking these to candidate human TFs via a motif2TF procedure. We validate iRegulon on gene sets derived from ENCODE ChIP-seq data with increasing levels of noise, and we compare iRegulon with existing motif discovery methods. Next, we use iRegulon on more challenging types of gene lists, including microRNA target sets, protein-protein interaction networks, and genetic perturbation data. In particular, we over-activate p53 in breast cancer cells, followed by RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, and could identify an extensive up-regulated network controlled directly by p53. Similarly we map a repressive network with no indication of direct p53 regulation but rather an indirect effect via E2F and NFY. Finally, we generalize our computational framework to include regulatory tracks such as ChIP-seq data and show how motif and track discovery can be combined to map functional regulatory interactions among co-expressed genes. iRegulon is available as a Cytoscape plugin from http://iregulon.aertslab.org.},

   abstract = {Gene expression is determined by genomic elements called enhancers, which contain short motifs bound by different transcription factors (TFs). However, how enhancer sequences and TF motifs relate to enhancer activity is unknown, and general sequence requirements for enhancers or comprehensive sets of important enhancer sequence elements have remained elusive. Here, we computationally dissect thousands of functional enhancer sequences from three different Drosophila cell lines. We find that the enhancers display distinct cis-regulatory sequence signatures, which are predictive of the enhancers' cell type-specific or broad activities. These signatures contain transcription factor motifs and a novel class of enhancer sequence elements, dinucleotide repeat motifs (DRMs). DRMs are highly enriched in enhancers, particularly in enhancers that are broadly active across different cell types. We experimentally validate the importance of the identified TF motifs and DRMs for enhancer function and show that they can be sufficient to create an active enhancer de novo from a nonfunctional sequence. The function of DRMs as a novel class of general enhancer features that are also enriched in human regulatory regions might explain their implication in several diseases and provides important insights into gene regulation. © 2014 Yáñez-Cuna et al.},

Using an established in vivo assay for PRE activity, we demonstrated that a subset of characterized developmental enhancers can function as PREs, silencing transcription in a Polycomb-dependent manner. Conversely, some classic <italic>Drosophila</italic> PREs can function as developmental enhancers in vivo, activating spatio–temporal expression. This study therefore uncovers elements with dual function: activating transcription in some cells (enhancers) while stably maintaining transcriptional silencing in others (PREs). Given that enhancers initiate spatio–temporal gene expression, reuse of the same elements by the Polycomb group (PcG) system may help fine-tune gene expression and ensure the timely maintenance of cell identities. </p>},

For most cancer types, this landscape consists of a small number of “mountains” (genes altered in a high percentage of tumors) and a much larger number of “hills” (genes altered infrequently). To date, these studies have revealed ~140 genes that, when altered by intragenic mutations, can promote or “drive” tumorigenesis. A typical tumor contains two to eight of these “driver gene” mutations; the remaining mutations are passengers that confer no selective growth advantage. Driver genes can be classified into 12 signaling pathways that regulate three core cellular processes: cell fate, cell survival, and genome maintenance. A better understanding of these pathways is one of the most pressing needs in basic cancer research. Even now, however, our knowledge of cancer genomes is sufficient to guide the development of more effective approaches for reducing cancer morbidity and mortality.</p>},

Here, we catalog the expression of exons, genes, and unannotated transcriptional signals for 25 lines. Unannotated transcription is substantial (typically 19% of euchromatic signal). Conservatively, we identify 1405 novel transcribed regions; 684 of these appear to be new exons of neighboring, often distant, genes. Sixty-four percent of genes are expressed detectably in at least one line, but only 21% are detected in all lines. Each cell line expresses, on average, 5885 genes, including a common set of 3109. Expression levels vary over several orders of magnitude. Major signaling pathways are well represented: most differentiation pathways are “off” and survival/growth pathways “on.” Roughly 50% of the genes expressed by each line are not part of the common set, and these show considerable individuality. Thirty-one percent are expressed at a higher level in at least one cell line than in any single developmental stage, suggesting that each line is enriched for genes characteristic of small sets of cells. Most remarkable is that imaginal disc-derived lines can generally be assigned, on the basis of expression, to small territories within developing discs. These mappings reveal unexpected stability of even fine-grained spatial determination. No two cell lines show identical transcription factor expression. We conclude that each line has retained features of an individual founder cell superimposed on a common “cell line“ gene expression pattern. </p>},

   abstract = {<p>Inactivating mutations in the Drosophila tumor-suppressor genes result in tissue overgrowth. This can occur because the mutant tissue either grows faster than wild-type tissue and/or continues to grow beyond a time when wild-type tissue stops growing. There are three general classes of tumor-suppressor genes that regulate the growth of imaginal disc epithelia. Mutations in the hyperplastic tumor-suppressor genes result in increased cell proliferation but do not disrupt normal tissue architecture. These genes include pten, Tsc1, Tsc2, and components of the hippo/salvador/warts pathway. Mutations in a second class of genes, the neoplastic tumor-suppressor genes, disrupt proteins that function either as scaffolds at cell-cell junctions (scribble, discs large, lgl) or as components of the endocytic pathway (avalanche, rab5, ESCRT components). For the third group, the nonautonomous tumor-suppressor genes, mutant cells stimulate the proliferation of adjacent wild-type cells. Understanding the interactions between these three classes of genes will improve our understanding of how cell and tissue growth are coordinated during organismal development and perturbed in disease states such as cancer.</p>},

Recent advances in scRNA-seq have enabled the pooling of cells from multiple samples into single libraries, thereby increasing sample throughput while reducing technical batch effects, library preparation time, and the overall cost. However, a comparative analysis of scRNA-seq methods with and without sample multiplexing is lacking. In this study, we benchmarked methods from two representative platforms: Parse Biosciences (Parse; with sample multiplexing) and 10X Genomics (10x; without sample multiplexing). By using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from two healthy individuals, we demonstrate that demultiplexed scRNA-seq data obtained from Parse showed similar cell type frequencies compared to 10X data where samples are not multiplexed. Despite a relatively lower library and cell capture efficiencies, Parse can detect rare cell types (e.g. plasmablasts and dendritic cells) which is likely due to its relatively higher sensitivity in gene detection. Moreover, comparative analysis of transcript quantification between the two platforms revealed platform-specific distributions of gene length and GC content. These results offer guidance for researchers in designing high-throughput scRNA-seq studies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Because mitochondria are key regulators of cellular metabolism, we have investigated a potential link between external growth conditions and nuclear chromosome instability in cells with mitochondrial defects. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we found that cells lacking mitochondrial DNA (rho0 cells) have a unique feature, with nuclear chromosome instability that occurs in nondividing cells and strongly fluctuates depending on the cellular environment. Calorie restriction, lower growth temperatures, growth at alkaline pH, antioxidants (NAC, Tiron), or presence of nearby wild-type cells all efficiently stabilize nuclear genomes of rho0 cells, whereas high glucose and ethanol boost instability. In contrast, other respiratory mutants that still possess mitochondrial DNA (RHO+) keep fairly constant instability rates under the same growth conditions, like wild-type or other RHO+ controls. Our data identify mitochondrial defects as an important driver of nuclear genome instability influenced by environmental factors.</p>},

The polarity regulators of the Drosophila Scribble (Scrib) module are potent tumor suppressors and provide a model for mechanistic investigation. RNA profiling of Scrib mutant tumors reveals multiple signatures of neoplasia, including altered metabolism and dedifferentiation. Prominent among these is upregulation of cytokine-like Unpaired (Upd) ligands, which drive tumor overgrowth. We identified a polarity-responsive enhancer in upd3, which is activated in a coincident manner by both JNK-dependent Fos and aPKC-mediated Yki transcription. This enhancer, and Scrib mutant overgrowth in general, are also sensitive to activity of the Polycomb Group (PcG), suggesting that PcG attenuation upon polarity loss potentiates select targets for activation by JNK and Yki. Our results link epithelial organization to signaling and epigenetic regulators that control tissue repair programs, and provide insight into why epithelial polarity is tumor-suppressive.},

We report the response of apoptosis-deficient cells to transient activation of JNK and show that it causes persistent JNK function during the rest of the development. As a consequence, there is continuous activity of the downstream pathways JAK/STAT, Wg and Dpp, which results in tumour overgrowths.

   abstract = {<p>Tumor initiation is often linked to a loss of cellular identity. Transcriptional programs determining cellular identity are preserved by epigenetically-acting chromatin factors. Although such regulators are among the most frequently mutated genes in cancer, it is not well understood how an abnormal epigenetic condition contributes to tumor onset. In this work, we investigated the gene signature of tumors caused by disruption of the Drosophila epigenetic regulator, polyhomeotic (ph). In larval tissue ph mutant cells show a shift towards an embryonic-like signature. Using loss- and gain-of-function experiments we uncovered the embryonic transcription factor knirps (kni) as a new oncogene. The oncogenic potential of kni lies in its ability to activate JAK/STAT signaling and block differentiation. Conversely, tumor growth in ph mutant cells can be substantially reduced by overexpressing a differentiation factor. This demonstrates that epigenetically derailed tumor conditions can be reversed when targeting key players in the transcriptional network.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>The small GTPase Rab5 has emerged as an important regulator of animal development, and it is essential for endocytic trafficking. However, the mechanisms that link Rab5 activation to cargo entry into early endosomes remain unclear. We show here that Drosophila Rabenosyn (Rbsn) is a Rab5 effector that bridges an interaction between Rab5 and the Sec1/Munc18-family protein Vps45, and we further identify the syntaxin Avalanche (Avl) as a target for Vps45 activity. Rbsn and Vps45, like Avl and Rab5, are specifically localized to early endosomes and are required for endocytosis. Ultrastructural analysis of rbsn, Vps45, avl, and Rab5 null mutant cells, which show identical defects, demonstrates that all four proteins are required for vesicle fusion to form early endosomes. These defects lead to loss of epithelial polarity in mutant tissues, which overproliferate to form neoplastic tumors. This work represents the first characterization of a Rab5 effector as a tumor suppressor, and it provides in vivo evidence for a Rbsn–Vps45 complex on early endosomes that links Rab5 to the SNARE fusion machinery.</p>},

Currently, in spite of great advances in radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the prognosis for AML patients with initial treatment failure is still poor. Therefore, the need for novel and efficient therapies to improve AML treatment outcome has become desperately urgent. In this study, we identified the expression of ZEB1 (a transcription factor) and focused on its possible role and mechanisms in the progression of AML. According to the data provided by the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), high expression of ZEB1 closely correlates with poor prognosis in AML patients. Additionally, the overexpression of ZEB1 was observed in both AML patients and cell lines. Further functional experiments showed that ZEB1 depletion can induce AML differentiation and inhibit AML proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, ZEB1 expression was negatively correlated with tumour suppressor P53 expression and ZEB1 can directly bind to P53. Our results also revealed that ZEB1 can regulate PTEN/PI3K/AKT signalling pathway. The inhibitory effect of ZEB1 silencing on PTEN/PI3K/AKT signalling pathway could be significantly reversed by P53 small interfering RNA treatment. Overall, the present data indicated that ZEB1 may be a promising therapeutic target for AML treatment or a potential biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis.</p>},

Although enhancers have been extensively studied in isolation, a substantial number of genes have more than one simultaneously active enhancer, and it remains unclear how these cooperate to regulate transcription. Using <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> S2 cells as a model, we assay the activities of more than a thousand individual enhancers and about a million enhancer pairs toward housekeeping and developmental core promoters with STARR-seq. We report that housekeeping and developmental enhancers show distinct modes of enhancer-enhancer cooperativity: while housekeeping enhancers are additive such that their combined activity mirrors the sum of their individual activities, developmental enhancers are super-additive and combine multiplicatively. Super-additivity between developmental enhancers is promiscuous and neither depends on the enhancers’ endogenous genomic contexts nor on specific transcription factor motif signatures. However, it can be further boosted by Twist and Trl motifs and saturates for the highest levels of enhancer activity. These results have important implications for our understanding of gene regulation in complex multi-enhancer developmental loci and genomically clustered housekeeping genes, providing a rationale to interpret the transcriptional impact of non-coding mutations at different loci. </p>},

ORFtag uses retroviral vectors bearing a promoter, peptide tag and splice donor to generate fusions between the tag and endogenous open reading frames (ORFs). We demonstrate the utility of ORFtag through functional screens for transcriptional activators, repressors and posttranscriptional regulators in mouse embryonic stem cells. Each screen recovers known and identifies new regulators, including long ORFs inaccessible by other methods. Among other hits, we find that Zfp574 is a highly selective transcriptional activator and that oncogenic fusions often function as transactivators.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>The Polycomb system has fundamental roles in regulating gene expression during mammalian development. However, how it controls transcription to enable gene repression has remained enigmatic. Here, using rapid degron-based depletion coupled with live-cell transcription imaging and single-particle tracking, we show how the Polycomb system controls transcription in single cells. We discover that the Polycomb system is not a constitutive block to transcription but instead sustains a long-lived deep promoter OFF state, which limits the frequency with which the promoter can enter into a transcribing state. We demonstrate that Polycomb sustains this deep promoter OFF state by counteracting the binding of factors that enable early transcription pre-initiation complex formation and show that this is necessary for gene repression. Together, these important discoveries provide a rationale for how the Polycomb system controls transcription and suggests a universal mechanism that could enable the Polycomb system to constrain transcription across diverse cellular contexts.</p>},

   abstract = {<p> Cancer initiation and progression are typically associated with the accumulation of driver mutations and genomic instability. However, recent studies demonstrated that cancer can also be driven purely by epigenetic alterations, without driver mutations. Specifically, a 24-h transient downregulation of <italic>polyhomeotic</italic> ( <italic>ph</italic> -KD), a core component of the Polycomb complex PRC1, is sufficient to induce epigenetically initiated cancers (EICs) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> , which are proficient in DNA repair and characterized by a stable genome. Whether genomic instability eventually occurs when PRC1 downregulation is performed for extended periods of time remains unclear. Here, we show that prolonged depletion of PH, which mimics cancer initiating events, results in broad dysregulation of DNA replication and repair genes, along with the accumulation of DNA breaks, defective repair, and widespread genomic instability in the cancer tissue. A broad misregulation of H2AK118 ubiquitylation and to a lesser extent of H3K27 trimethylation also occurs and might contribute to these phenotypes. Together, this study supports a model where DNA repair and replication defects accumulate during the tumorigenic transformation epigenetically induced by PRC1 loss, resulting in genomic instability and cancer progression. </p>},

   abstract = {<p> All multicellular life relies on differential gene expression, determined by regulatory DNA elements and DNA‐binding transcription factors that mediate activation and repression via cofactor recruitment. While activators have been extensively characterized, repressors are less well studied: the identities and properties of their repressive domains (RDs) are typically unknown and the specific co‐repressors (CoRs) they recruit have not been determined. Here, we develop a high‐throughput, next‐generation sequencing‐based screening method, repressive‐domain (RD)‐seq, to systematically identify RDs in complex DNA‐fragment libraries. Screening more than 200,000 fragments covering the coding sequences of all transcription‐related proteins in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> , we identify 195 RDs in known repressors and in proteins not previously associated with repression. Many RDs contain recurrent short peptide motifs, which are conserved between fly and human and are required for RD function, as demonstrated by motif mutagenesis. Moreover, we show that RDs that contain one of five distinct repressive motifs interact with and depend on different CoRs, such as Groucho, CtBP, Sin3A, or Smrter. These findings advance our understanding of repressors, their sequences, and the functional impact of sequence‐altering mutations and should provide a valuable resource for further studies. </p>},

   abstract = {<p>Imaging-based methods are widely used for studying the subcellular localization of proteins in living cells. While routine for individual proteins, global monitoring of protein dynamics following perturbation typically relies on arrayed panels of fluorescently tagged cell lines, limiting throughput and scalability. Here, we describe a strategy that combines high-throughput microscopy, computer vision and machine learning to detect perturbation-induced changes in multicolour tagged visual proteomics cell (vpCell) pools. We use genome-wide and cancer-focused intron-targeting sgRNA libraries to generate vpCell pools and a large, arrayed collection of clones each expressing two different endogenously tagged fluorescent proteins. Individual clones can be identified in vpCell pools by image analysis using the localization patterns and expression level of the tagged proteins as visual barcodes, enabling simultaneous live-cell monitoring of large sets of proteins. To demonstrate broad applicability and scale, we test the effects of antiproliferative compounds on a pool with cancer-related proteins, on which we identify widespread protein localization changes and new inhibitors of the nuclear import/export machinery. The time-resolved characterization of changes in subcellular localization and abundance of proteins upon perturbation in a pooled format highlights the power of the vpCell approach for drug discovery and mechanism-of-action studies.</p>},
