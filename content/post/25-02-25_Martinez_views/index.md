Cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Known since antiquity, its understanding has evolved over time and has significantly advanced with new technologies over the past four decades. Cancer initiation is currently admitted to be explainable by the somatic mutation theory, which postulates that DNA mutations altering the function of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes initiate cancer. In addition to these mutations, epigenetic alterations, which heritably change gene expression without altering the DNA sequence, also play a key role. Recent data suggests that epigenetic components regulate all aspects of tumor progression, including cancer initiation. These discoveries prompt a reevaluation of the somatic mutation theory, of cancer prevention and treatment strategies.
