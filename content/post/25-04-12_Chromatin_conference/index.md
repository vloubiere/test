The aim of this conference is to bring together researchers from southern France to share their recent scientific advances in the field of chromatin biology.

We hope that this meeting will encourage informal exchanges on current projects, fostering new research opportunities and collaborations.

Importantly, young researchers (PhD students, post-docs, and recently recruited researchers) are strongly encouraged to present their work.
